#This repo consists of root codes for generating the e-e+ peak from a monte carlo simulated data file

#Edit 1: Now using roofit to fit data. Original fit functions are still there in the comments below the code.

#Edit 2: Using Bernstein Polynomial to fit the background

#Edit 3: Fitting with Crystal ball and Bernstein Polynomial.
